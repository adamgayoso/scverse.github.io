It gives a different feeling than the one you get from starting a repository for an exciting new project but it is still pretty great â€” we are starting a new organisation to maintain and support foundational tools in the life sciences.

Our primary experience lies in the field of computational genomics and lately single-cell sequencing technologies, and this has defined our scope and focus in the very beginning of our journey that we have called {{< rawhtml >}}<span class="backticked">scverse</span>{{< /rawhtml >}}.

## What this is about


{{< rawhtml >}}<span class="backticked">scverse</span>{{< /rawhtml >}} is a consortium for joint maintenance of core packages in omics data analysis in life sciences. It has been founded to ensure the long-term maintenance of the core infrastructure in the field.

## What we busy with

While we're continuing to work on the scverse libraries, we're trying to improve how they work and are tested together.

## What is coming next

We're particularly excited about the community coming together for this effort with so many brilliant people involved who design tools, write code, manage and analyse data, visualise results... Please feel invited to {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://discord.gg/zDVDtFFcNe" target="_blank">join us on Discord</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}, and make sure to {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://twitter.com/scanpy_team" target="_blank">follow us on Twitter</a>{{< /rawhtml >}} to keep track of scverse updates.
